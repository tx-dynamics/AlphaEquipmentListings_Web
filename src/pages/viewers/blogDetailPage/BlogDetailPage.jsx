                  <h3>1. Buy from a reputable seller</h3>
                  <img src={dummyOne} />
                  <h2>It’s important to ensure you are dealing with a legitimate and reputable business by checking the following</h2>
                  <h4>Public company records.</h4>
                  <h2>The best way to protect yourself is to do business with companies that have a long history and large customer base. Publicly-traded companies are required to publish financial statements, so you can easily find out if the company is stable and likely to be in business over the long term.</h2>
                  <h4>Online reviews.</h4>
                  <h2>Google and Facebook are good places to find unbiased customer reviews. Once published, Google and Facebook reviews can’t be removed or edited by the Google Business or Facebook page owner.</h2>

                  <h4>Customer testimonials.</h4>
                  <h2>Many companies publish customer testimonials on their website. The more frequent, the better. Customer testimonials show that other equipment buyers are more than willing to endorse the seller.</h2>
                  <h4>Better Business Bureau.</h4>
                  <h2>Visit the Better Business Bureau in your area and search for the business from which you are considering buying used equipment. The Better Business Bureau maintains a list of businesses with contact information and reported consumer complaints.</h2>
                  <h3>2. Do a background check</h3>
